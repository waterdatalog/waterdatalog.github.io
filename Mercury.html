            <h3>What is Mercury?</h3>
            <p>Mercury is the 80th element of the periodic table. Mercury has two forms: organic and inorganic. Organic mercury is often found in nature, in chemical compounds. Inorganic mercury is pure mercury. With exposure comonly found in machines. Exposure to inorganic mercury at low levels can cause potiental tooth loss and nervous system problems. Once mercury is in the air, it can find its way into the fish of the water. When fish that contains mercury is eaten, the mercury from the fish can poison the eater of the fish. The mercury can also find its way into drinking water. (Blanchfield, Deirdre S.)</p>

            <h3>How does Mercury get into the water?</h3>
            <p>Inorganic mercury can get into the water in many ways. One of which is through air polution. Emissions from factories can polute the air and the mercury can find its way into the water. (Blanchfield, Deirdre S.)</p>

            <h3>What can you do to help wih Mercury Pollution?</h3>
            <p>What an individual person can do about mercury pollution is very little to make any impact. Most of the work to fix the problem comes from big corporations. Fortunately Clean Air Act of 2004 from the US Enviromental Protection Agency was able to convince the Food and Drug Administration to set limits on the amount of mercury that can be sold in sefood (1mg of Hg / Kg).
